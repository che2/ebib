Ebib is a program for managing BibTeX databases. There are already quite a few such programs, but Ebib has a special property: it runs inside Emacs. If you are used to doing everything LaTeX from within Emacs, you may appreciate that you can manage your `.bib` files in Emacs as well. One distinct advantage of Ebib is that you do not need to switch to another window and copy/paste a BibTeX key into your LaTeX file with the mouse. Ebib provides functions with which you can select a key from the database and have it inserted directly into your LaTeX text.

Ebib is fully keyboard-operated. Unlike other BibTeX database managers, you do not need the mouse at all. Everything Ebib can do can be accomplished with simple one-key commands. This makes using Ebib much faster than other similar programs, which are usually mouse-operated. And because Emacs does not have to run under X, Ebib can be used without X as well.

Ebib provides the standard capabilities that one would expect from a BibTeX database manager: `.bib` files can be opened, modified (adding, deleting, modifying entries), searched, and saved. Apart from the basics, Ebib has quite a few extra features that make managing your BibTeX files easier.


## Features ##

### General ###

- Visual representation distinguishing obligatory, optional and additional fields.
- Copy/cut/paste mechanism for quickly copying field values. (This fully integrates with Emacs' kill ring.)
- Automatic loading of `.bib` files upon start-up.
- Extensive [user manual](ebib-manual.html).


### BibTeX ###

- Format of the `.bib` file is not restricted: everything that BibTeX accepts is also accepted by Ebib.
- Creating and editing `@string` and `@preamble` definitions is supported (`@comment`s are ignored).
- BibTeX entry and field types can be customised, allowing adaptation for non-standard and personal bibliography styles.
- Automatic creation of entry keys (using the functionality of Emacs' `bibtex-mode`).
- Field values containing newlines are supported, allowing the creation of annotated bibliographies.
- The database can be saved with the entries in the `.bib` file sorted on user-specified fields (useful in ConTeXt).
- Alternatively, the database can be saved with all entries containing a `crossref` field at the top of the `.bib` file, allowing you to make use of BibTeX's cross-referencing facility.
- Crossreferencing is supported, both BibTeX and biblatex mechanisms.


### Databases ###

- Multiple `.bib` files can be opened at the same time.
- Merging of a second `.bib` file with an already loaded database.
- Single or multiple entries can be exported to another file, or to another open database, allowing the creation of a new specialised `.bib` file from an existing one. `@preamble` and `@string` definitions can also be exported.


### Searching ###

- Simple regexp searches can be performed on a database, searching the contents of all fields of each entry.
- Complex search queries with logical `and`, `or` and `not` operators, built up interactively, can be performed, with the possibility of searching only specific fields. Search queries can be saved for later reuse.


### LaTeX integration ###

- From within a LaTeX document, it is possible to select (using TAB-completion) and insert a BibTeX key into the document. This can also be set up for other document formats that support automatic bibliographies: support for [Org mode](http://orgmode.org) and [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) Markdown is included.
- Inside Ebib, it is possible to push entries to a LaTeX buffer.
- Quick summary of entries into a `*Help*` buffer.
- Creating a `.bib` file from a `.bbl` file, allowing you to create a `.bib` file for a LaTeX document containing only the references in the document.


### Miscellaneous ###

- Entries can be imported from text buffers or from the `*scratch*` buffer (allowing copy & paste of BibTeX entries, e.g. from the Internet).
- A URL stored in a BibTeX field can be extracted and sent to a browser.
- Files stored in a BibTeX field can be opened with user-configurable viewers.
- A time stamp can be added to each new entry, allowing you to keep track of new additions in the database.
- (Parts of) databases can be printed, either as a list of references typeset by BibTeX, or directly as database entries.
- Keywords can be stored in a file to aid in maintaining uniformity in keywords within and across `.bib` files.

## Screenshots ##

Visually, Ebib is not very spectacular. But to get an impression of what it looks like, you can look at the following three screenshots. The first shows Ebib's standard lay-out, with the list of entry keys in the top window and the fields of the currently highlighted entry in the bottom window. (The field values displayed in a lighter colour come from the cross-referenced entry.) In the second image, the string 'Reuland' is highlighted as the result of a text search. The third screenshot shows the strings buffer, where you can edit the `@string` definitions in the database.
